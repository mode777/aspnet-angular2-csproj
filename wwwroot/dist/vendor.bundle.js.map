This DSL approach to describing\n   * animations allows for a flexibility that both benefits developers and the framework.\n   *\n   * Animations work by listening on state changes that occur on an element within\n   * the template. When a state change occurs, Angular can then take advantage and animate the\n   * arc in between. This works similar to how CSS transitions work, however, by having a\n   * programmatic DSL, animations are not limited to environments that are DOM-specific.\n   * (Angular can also perform optimizations behind the scenes to make animations more performant.)\n   *\n   * For animations to be available for use, animation state changes are placed within\n   * {@link trigger animation triggers} which are housed inside of the `animations` annotation\n   * metadata. Within a trigger both {@link state state} and {@link transition transition} entries\n   * can be placed.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'animation-cmp',\n   *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',\n   *   animations: [\n   *     // this here is our animation trigger that\n   *     // will contain our state change animations.\n   *     trigger('myTriggerName', [\n   *       // the styles defined for the `on` and `off`\n   *       // states declared below are persisted on the\n   *       // element once the animation completes.\n   *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),\n   *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),\n   *\n   *       // this here is our animation that kicks off when\n   *       // this state change jump is true\n   *       transition('on => off', [\n   *         animate(\"1s\")\n   *       ])\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As depicted in the code above, a group of related animation states are all contained within\n   * an animation `trigger` (the code example above called the trigger `myTriggerName`).\n   * When a trigger is created then it can be bound onto an element within the component's\n   * template via a property prefixed by an `@` symbol followed by trigger name and an expression\n   * that\n   * is used to determine the state value for that trigger.\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->\n   * <div @myTriggerName=\"expression\">...</div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * For state changes to be executed, the `expression` value must change value from its existing\n   * value\n   * to something that we have set an animation to animate on (in the example above we are listening\n   * to a change of state between `on` and `off`).

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n * \n * ### Local Variables\n * \n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n * \n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n * \n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Change Propagation\n * \n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n * \n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n * \n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n * \n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * \n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n * \n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgForOf<T> implements DoCheck, OnChanges {\n   ngForOf: NgIterable<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTrackBy(fn: TrackByFunction<T>) {\n    if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n      if ( /** @type {?} */((<any>console)) && /** @type {?} */(( <any>console.warn))) {\n        console.warn(\n            `trackBy must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}. ` +\n            `See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.`);\n      }\n    }\n    this._trackByFn = fn;\n  }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget ngForTrackBy(): TrackByFunction<T> { return this._trackByFn; }\nprivate _differ: IterableDiffer<T>|null = null;\nprivate _trackByFn: TrackByFunction<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} _template\n * @param {?} _differs\n */\nconstructor(\nprivate _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,\nprivate _template: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>,\nprivate _differs: IterableDiffers) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTemplate(value: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>) {\n    // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n    // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n    // should be acceptable.\n    if (value) {\n      this._template = value;\n    }\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n    if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n      // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n      const /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n      if (!this._differ && value) {\n        try {\n          this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n        } catch ( /** @type {?} */e) {\n          throw new Error(\n              `Cannot find a differ supporting object '${value}' of type '${getTypeNameForDebugging(value)}'.

Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n * \n * ## Using non-inlined `then` template\n * \n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n * \n * ## Storing conditional result in a variable\n * \n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n * \n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n * \n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n * \n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n * \n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n * \n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgIf {\nprivate _context: NgIfContext = new NgIfContext();\nprivate _thenTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\nprivate _elseTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\nprivate _thenViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\nprivate _elseViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} templateRef\n */\nconstructor(private _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {\n    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} condition\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngIf(condition: any) {\n    this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n    this._updateView();\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} templateRef\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngIfThen(templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {\n    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    this._thenViewRef = null;

Every element in the list\n * has identical properties.\n *\n * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n *\n * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `[Element]` element, the super element of all\n * elements.\n *\n * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n *\n * ## Properties\n *\n * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n * \n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n * \n * #### Syntax\n * \n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n * \n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n * \n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n * \n * \\@howToUse \n * \n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n * \n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n * \n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n * \n * ### Adding or removing controls\n * \n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n * \n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class FormArray extends AbstractControl {\n/**\n * @param {?} controls\n * @param {?=} validator\n * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n */\nconstructor(\npublic controls: AbstractControl[], validator?: ValidatorFn|null,\n      asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn|null) {\n    super(validator || null, asyncValidator || null);\n    this._initObservables();\n    this._setUpControls();\n    this.updateValueAndValidity({onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false});\n  }\n/**\n * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @return {?}\n */\nat(index: number): AbstractControl { return this.controls[index]; }\n/**\n * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\npush(control: AbstractControl): void {\n    this.controls.push(control);\n    this._registerControl(control);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\ninsert(index: number, control: AbstractControl): void {\n    this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n\n    this._registerControl(control);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @return {?}\n */\nremoveAt(index: number): void {\n    if (this.controls[index]) this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(() => {});\n    this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Replace an existing control.\n * @param {?} index\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\nsetControl(index: number, control: AbstractControl): void {\n    if (this.controls[index]) this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(() => {});\n    this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n\n    if (control) {\n      this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n      this._registerControl(control);\n    }\n\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Length of the control array.\n * @return {?}\n */\nget length(): number { return this.controls.length; }\n/**\n *  Sets the value of the {\\@link FormArray}.

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n * \n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n * \n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n * \n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n * \n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n * \n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n * \n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n * \n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n * \n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n * \n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgModel extends NgControl implements OnChanges,\n    OnDestroy {\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_control = new FormControl();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_registered = false;\n  viewModel: any;\n\n   name: string;\n   isDisabled: boolean;\n   model: any;\n   options: {name?: string, standalone?: boolean};\n\n   update = new EventEmitter();\n/**\n * @param {?} parent\n * @param {?} validators\n * @param {?} asyncValidators\n * @param {?} valueAccessors\n */\nconstructor(  parent: ControlContainer,\n                 validators: Array<Validator|ValidatorFn>,\n                 asyncValidators: Array<AsyncValidator|AsyncValidatorFn>,\n                \n              valueAccessors: ControlValueAccessor[]) {\n                super();\n                this._parent = parent;\n                this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n                this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n                this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n              }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {\n                this._checkForErrors();\n                if (!this._registered) this._setUpControl();\n                if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                  this._updateDisabled(changes);\n                }\n\n                if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                  this._updateValue(this.model);\n                  this.viewModel = this.model;\n                }\n              }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnDestroy(): void { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget control(): FormControl { return this._control; }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget path(): string[] {\n                return this._parent ?
